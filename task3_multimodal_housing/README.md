# Task 3 â€” Multimodal Housing Price Prediction (Images + Tabular)

- Extract image embeddings using a CNN (TorchVision ResNet18)
- Concatenate embeddings with tabular features
- Train an XGBoost regressor (or MLP)
- Evaluate with MAE and RMSE

Place:
- Tabular CSV: `housing_tabular.csv`
- Images in `images/` with a column `image_path` in the CSV.
